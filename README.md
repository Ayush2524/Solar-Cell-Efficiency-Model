# Solar-Cell-Efficiency-Model

Problem Statement:

Develop a predictive model to estimate solar cell efficiency under varying weather conditions
such as humidity, rain, cloud cover, and temperature, while analyzing their impact on key
performance metrics like power output and energy yield.

Abstract:

In this study, we developed a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm to estimate solar
cell efficiency under varying weather conditions. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and
originally web-scraped from pvoutput.org, was enriched with key environmental features
known to influence solar energy output. A feature importance analysis was conducted to
identify the most impactful variables, enabling a more focused and effective modeling
approach. The model was trained and tested using a standard train-test split, achieving a root
mean square error of 0.04802 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.02188. These results
demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques in accurately forecasting solar panel
performance, thereby aiding in the optimization of solar energy generation under dynamic
weather conditions.
